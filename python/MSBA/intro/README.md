## Expedia Hotel Recommendation
+ Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data

This is originally a Kaggle competition. We reproduced the solution while focusing on practicing data exploration skills using python pandas library, __which is obviously not suited for dealing with large datasets in real world.__ Since the original training set is 4GB on disk and takes more than 16GB loaded by pandas, the code is run on a server.

> The uploaded code only does data exploration.
