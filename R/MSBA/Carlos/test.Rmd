For this problem, the `Weekly` dataset is split into a training set composed of record on and prior to 2008, while the fitted model will be tested on the records from 2009 onwards.
When modeling solely on `Lag2`, the prediction quality is similar to the previous example. While in reality the _Up/Down_ ratio is $\frac{56+5}{34+9}\approx1.4$, the prediction gives $\frac{34+56}{9+5}\approx6.4$, which is equivalent to an overall fraction of correct predictions of $\frac{56+9}{56+9+5+34}=62.5\%$.
